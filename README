Description: 
	Allows you to have links like http://wiki.mediatemple.net/a/134 
	which redirects the user to
	http://wiki.mediatemple.net/w/Serving_websites_with_Nginx_on_Ubuntu_9.10

	It will capture new articles upon their creation as well, and create 
	their repsective link.

Installation:
	Please see INSTALL file for detailed installation instructions.

Use:
	Once "installed" start adding <shortlink/> tags to your pages,
	and sharing those links.

Note:
	File attachments, or anything that matches the regular expression
	\.(gif|jpe?g|png|PNG)$
	Will be excluded from link creation. This is by design.

TODO:
	- Add API code to return the shortlink along with requests.
	- Rewrite some of the code to work on more setups ($wgArticlePath)
	- Take requests from other people and implement them.
