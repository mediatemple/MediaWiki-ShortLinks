MediaWiki ShortLinks

License: MIT License, see LICENSE file for details.

Description: 
	Allows you to have links like http://wiki.mediatemple.net/a/134 
	which redirects the user to
	http://wiki.mediatemple.net/w/Serving_websites_with_Nginx_on_Ubuntu_9.10

	It will capture new articles upon their creation as well, and create 
	their repsective link.
 
 Installation:
 	Include this file in your LocalSettings.php, and then visit:
	http://your_domain.com/path/to/wiki/index.php?action=installShortLinks
 	This creates the databse structure and adds the current articles.
	In an article, use <shortlink/> to display that articles link.
	There must also be a rewrite rule like the following:
 	RewriteRule ^a/[0-9]+/?$	index.php?action=viewShortLink [NC,L]

 Use:
	Once "installed" start adding <shortlink/> tags to your pages,
	and sharing those links.

 Note:
	File attachments, or anything that matches the regular expression
	\.[a-zA-Z]{3,4}$
	Will be excluded from link creation. This is by design.

 TODO:
	- Add API code to return the shortlink along with requests.
	- Rewrite some of the code to work on more setups ($wgArticlePath)
	- Take requests from other people and implement them.

 Known Bugs:
	- Some articles don't get added to databse upon creation, or 
	  during installation.
