Installing ShortLinks:

This installation guide assumes you are using mod_rewrite with Apache.
If you are not, and you're using something else like nginx, well then 
I trust in your ability to make the redirection work without further
instruction. :)

Step 0:
	Download latest version of this script, you seem to have already done 
	that, considering you are reading this file. ;)

Step 1:
	Upload shortlinks.php to the extensions directory of your MediaWiki 
	installation.

Step 2:
	Open up your favorite editor at edit the LocalSettings.php file in
	the document root, and append the following:

	require_once("$IP/extensions/shortlinks.php");

	If you uploaded this entire directory, then use the following:

	require_once("$IP/extensions/MediaWiki-ShortLinks/shortlinks.php");

Step 3:
	In the document root, open up the .htaccess file, and append the following rule:
	
	RewriteRule ^a/[0-9]+/?$	index.php?action=viewShortLink [NC,L]

Step 4:
	In your favorite browser, proceed to the following:

	http://your_domain.com/path/to/media/wiki/index.php?action=installShortLinks

	Replacing your_domain.com with the appropriate domain, and the 
	path/to/media/wiki/ with the appropriate path to the index.php file.

	On this page you will see a list of articles that are being added to the
	newly created shortlinks table. At the bottom will be a count of how many
	pages were added.

	Please be patient, this process may take a while, depending on how many
	articles you have installed!

Step 5:
	???

Step 6:
	Profit!

After following these steps, adding a <shortlink/> tag to any page will display
it's short link (if it is available). Image files by default do not generate a
short link.
